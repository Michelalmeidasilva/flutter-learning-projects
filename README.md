## Flutter Learning Projects
This repository contains various projects for learning different architecture patterns in Flutter, such as MVC, MVVM, MVP, clean code, and more.

### Overview
The aim of this project is to provide practical examples of implementing different architecture patterns in Flutter app development. Each project is a separate example that demonstrates how to apply a specific pattern, allowing developers to learn and better understand the structure and benefits of each approach.

### Available Projects
flutter_mvc_project - This project demonstrates the implementation of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern in Flutter. It separates responsibilities into three main components: model (data), view (user interface), and controller (business logic).

flutter_mvvm_project - This project illustrates the implementation of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern in Flutter. MVVM separates the presentation layer from the business logic, using a ViewModel to represent the data and actions related to a particular screen.

flutter_mvp_project - This project exemplifies the implementation of the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern in Flutter. MVP divides the application into three main parts: model (data), view (user interface), and presenter (controls the interaction between the model and the view).

flutter_clean_code_project - This project demonstrates how to follow the principles of clean code in Flutter app development. It emphasizes the readability, maintainability, and testability of the code through good practices like meaningful naming, short and well-defined functions, and proper modularization.
